Do not forget to say thanks to [this](https://github.com/michaelmacinnis) sir.  

This great sir is our sun light, after this grit:lab [creature](linkedin.com/in/dick-carstens-a404a265), with name penis(dick), crapped other students road, in the last weeks before deadline (of course after he passed all the projects, and his ass was in safe).  

According to not confirmed info, i did not see this personally, the last audit of the five audits of 0-shell project of the group of the dick, the solution crashed two times in auditing process. But it was the last audit, x4 audits before was passed. After project was passed, dick made issue on github, and crap to other students road.  

The country must know its heroes.
